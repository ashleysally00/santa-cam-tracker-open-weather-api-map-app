The **Santa Cam Tracker** shows Santa's location on the map and calls the OpenWeather API to fetch and display the current weather for his location. Additionally, the animated sleigh is visible flying in the Santa Cam viewer for a magical experience.

# Watch the Santa's Sleigh Video!

This video was created using **Sora**, an AI video generator that has high resolution (up to 1080p) and fast rendering times. Though I have just started experimenting with it, I like it for storytelling or building immersive experiences.

## Video Prompt Details

Here's the prompt used to generate the video:

* **Scene 1 (3 seconds):** Start with a festive intro showing a map lighting up with a moving sleigh icon.

* **Scene 2 (8 seconds):** Showcase the Santa Cam in action, generating a 20-second AI video of Santa flying over iconic locations (e.g., the Eiffel Tower, snowy mountains, or a cozy neighborhood). Highlight the smooth animation and crisp 1080p resolution.

* **Scene 3:** Show Santa flying through a snowstorm in his sleigh, with wind, then rainstorms. Transition into a scene where he is flying over a beach with palm trees.

* **Final Scene (4 seconds):** Show a house with Santa flying over it into a neighborhood at night with sparkling stars.

I made a truncated version of the video for this projet to showcase the Santacam experience. You can check it out [here](https://sora.com/g/gen_01jf0q73reehksjme8c90aernp).
